# F2-MT-Project
Task You have been given an array, import that in your html and js project.

Create a UI as shown in the figma.

Map all the 100 elements in the table as shown. Make sure that the Name column has image of the student, and the full name. (first_name + lastname). Also the passing attribute is a boolean in the array, but in the table you have to show either passing or failed. If passing is true show passing, otherwise if the boolean is false, show failed.

By default the table will show the data in the order of the array file.

Make a search bar which searches and updates the table data. It should filter out on the bases of first name, last name, and email and shouldn't be case sensitive.

The search functionality can work on handleChange or use the search button click event to show th eupdated table data.

Then make a flex-box with all the buttons having maximum space between them.

On the click of the buttons sort the array - do the following: Sort A->Z means ascending order of full name. Sort Z->A means descending order of full name. Sort by marks means ascending order of marks. Sort by passing means only show students who are passing. Sort by class means in the ascending order of class. When you click on sort by gender, you show 2 tables, one containing all female students and the other containing all male students. Both should be shown, show them one below each other.
